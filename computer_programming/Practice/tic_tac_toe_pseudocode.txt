#BHR 2nd tic tac toe pseudocode

import random module

set up board using nine variables: TOP_RIGHT, TOP_MIDDLE, MIDDLE_MIDDLE, etc.
set up scores for how many times the player and robot have won(PLAYER_SCORE = 0 (next line)ROBOT_SCORE = 0)

loop
    if tic tac toe board empty
        check if the player wants to quit
        if they want to quit
            exit the loop
        decide who goes first using the random(1 for player, 2 for robot)
    if robot goes first
        loop
            randomly select a number from 1 through 9
            check if the respective variable is free
            if it is free
                exit the loop
            else if it is not free
                keep on going (this part is redundant in real code)
            otherwise
                just clear the variable because something broke
        change the turn to the user(will skip over the users turn to the display phase)
    else if user goes first (if the robot "if statement" is true, it will skip over this if statement)
        loop
            ask the user which box they want to select using numbers 1 through 9
            check if the respective variable is free
            if it is free
                exit the loop
            else if it is not free
                keep on going (this part is redundant in real code)
        change the turn to the robot's turn
    mark the box as taken by the respective user or robot
    set the variable used to transport the information to 0
    display the tic tac toe board using f string(a way to insert variables into a string of text) and ascii art(a method of creating art in python)
    go through every possible win situation to check if there is a win situation(if TOP_RIGHT == 1 and TOP_MIDDLE == 1 and TOP_LEFT == 1 or TOP_RIGHT == 2 and TOP_MIDDLE == 2 and TOP_LEFT == 2 etc. )
    if the user won
        display "congrats! you won! "
        set all the variables for the boxes in tic tac toe to 0
        add one to the player's score(PLAYER_SCORE += 1)
    if the robot won
        display "ha ha! you lost. "
        set all the variables for the boxes in tic tac toe to 0
        add one to the robot's score(ROBOT_SCORE += 1)
